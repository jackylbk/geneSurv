# geneSurv: an interactive web-tool for survival analysis for genetic researchWe developed an easy-to-use, up-to-date, comprehensive and interactive web-based tool for survival analysis. This tool includes analysis procedures for life table, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Each procedure includes following features:Life table: descriptive statistics, life table, median life time, hazard ratios and comparison tests including Log-rank, Gehan-Breslow, Tarone-Ware, Peto-Peto, Modified Peto-Peto, Flemington-Harrington.Kaplan-Meier: descriptive statistics, survival table, mean and median life time, hazard ratios, comparison tests including Log-rank, Gehan-Breslow, Tarone-Ware, Peto-Peto, Modified Peto-Peto, Flemington-Harrington, and interactive plots such as Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard plots.Cox regression: coefficient estimates, hazard ratios, goodness of fit test, analysis of deviance, save predictions, save residuals, save Martingale residuals, save Schoenfeld residuals, save dfBetas, proprtiona hazard assumption test, and interactive plots including Schoenfeld residual plot and Log-Minus-Log plot.![My image](www/screenShots/ss1.jpg?raw=true "About")
